"""
This file contains all the algorithms we have written to extract a leafy spanning tree
from a graph.

Every algorithm should be written in its own function, conforming to the following signature:

	def my_algorithm(graph):
		# Clever algorithm goes here
		return tree

IMPORTANT: At the bottom of this file, make sure that all algorithm functions are stored
in the ALGORITHMS list. This allows them to be called from graph_solver.py.
