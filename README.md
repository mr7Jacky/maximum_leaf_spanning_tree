# Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree Project

#### Introduction
This project is adapted from [Berkeley CS 170 Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree contest](https://github.com/jimmyjwu/maximum_leaf_spanning_tree). We restructured the algorithm and change the file I/Os.

#### Quick Start
```bash
python solver.py
```

#### Usage
```bash
usage: solver.py [-h] [-r NUM_RAND_RUNS] [-m {rand,forest}] [-n MAX_NUM_NODES] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r NUM_RAND_RUNS, --num_rand_runs NUM_RAND_RUNS
                        Number of random runs for spanning tree algorithm
  -m {rand,forest}, --mode {rand,forest}
                        Choose which algorithm to use,"rand" represent randomized tree algorithm"forest" represent joined forest tree algorithm
  -n MAX_NUM_NODES, --max_num_nodes MAX_NUM_NODES
                        Maximum number of nodes in a graph
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input file path
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file path
```

#### File Structure
project_description.pdf		- States the problem and specifies the file format for inputs (graphs) and outputs (trees).

solver.py 					- Our primary module for generating leafy spanning trees from graphs.

src/						- Contains instructor-provided tools.
	disjointsets.py 		- Contains an implementation of the disjoint sets data structure.
	graph.py 				- Contains useful graph-related classes.
	graph_helper.py 		- Contains useful helper methods for dealing with graphs.
	input_output.py 		- Contains functions for reading and writing graphs from/to files.
	solver_algorithms.py 	- Contains all our algorithms for solving graphs.

sample/						- Contains sample inputs, some hard instances
